abstract={E-finance is defined as ``The provision of financial services and markets using electronic communication and computation''. In this paper we outline research issues related to e-finance that we believe set the stage for further work in this field. Three areas are focused on. These are the use of electronic payments systems, the operations of financial services firms and the operation of financial markets. A number of research issues are raised. For example, is the widespread use of paper-based checks efficient? Will the financial services industry be fundamentally changed by the advent of the Internet? Why have there been such large differences in changes to market microstructure across different financial markets?},

abstract={This article describes an emergent logic of accumulation in the networked sphere, `surveillance capitalism,' and considers its implications for `information civilization.' The institutionalizing practices and operational assumptions of Google Inc. are the primary lens for this analysis as they are rendered in two recent articles authored by Google Chief Economist Hal Varian. Varian asserts four uses that follow from computer-mediated transactions: `data extraction and analysis,' `new contractual forms due to better monitoring,' `personalization and customization,' and `continuous experiments.' An examination of the nature and consequences of these uses sheds light on the implicit logic of surveillance capitalism and the global architecture of computer mediation upon which it depends. This architecture produces a distributed and largely uncontested new expression of power that I christen: `Big Other.' It is constituted by unexpected and often illegible mechanisms of extraction, commodification, and control that effectively exile persons from their own behavior while producing new markets of behavioral prediction and modification. Surveillance capitalism challenges democratic norms and departs in key ways from the centuries-long evolution of market capitalism.},

	abstract = {In many application areas like e-science and data-warehousing detailed
information about the origin of data is required. This kind of information is often referred
to as data provenance or data lineage. The provenance of a data item includes
information about the processes and source data items that lead to its creation and
current representation. The diversity of data representation models and application
domains has lead to a number of more or less formal definitions of provenance. Most
of them are limited to a special application domain, data representation model or data
processing facility. Not surprisingly, the associated implementations are also restricted
to some application domain and depend on a special data model. In this paper we give
a survey of data provenance models and prototypes, present a general categorization
scheme for provenance models and use this categorization scheme to study the properties
of the existing approaches. This categorization enables us to distinguish between
different kinds of provenance information and could lead to a better understanding of
provenance in general. Besides the categorization of provenance types, it is important
to include the storage, transformation and query requirements for the different kinds of
provenance information and application domains in our considerations. The analysis
of existing approaches will assist us in revealing open research problems in the area of
data provenance.},

Of the 600 most commonly used apps, only 183 (30.5\\) had privacy policies. Average policy length was 1755 (SD 1301) words with a reading grade level of 16 (SD 2.9). Two thirds (66.1\\) of privacy policies did not specifically address the app itself. Our findings show that currently mHealth developers often fail to provide app privacy policies. The privacy policies that are available do not make information privacy practices transparent to users, require college-level literacy, and are often not focused on the app itself. Further research is warranted to address why privacy policies are often absent, opaque, or irrelevant, and to find a remedy.}",

	abstract = {Objective
The creation and exchange of patients’ Electronic Healthcare Records have developed significantly in the last decade. Patients’ records are however distributed in data silos across multiple healthcare facilities, posing technical and clinical challenges that may endanger patients’ safety. Current healthcare sharing systems ensure interoperability of patients’ records across facilities, but they have limits in presenting doctors with the clinical context of the data in the records. We design and implement a platform for managing provenance tracking of Electronic Healthcare Records based on blockchain technology, compliant with the latest healthcare standards and following the patient-informed consent preferences.
Methods
The platform leverages two pillars: the use of international standards such as Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE), Health Level Seven International (HL7) and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) to achieve interoperability, and the use of a provenance creation process that by-design, avoids personal data storage within the blockchain. The platform consists of: (1) a smart contract implemented within the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain that manages provenance according to the W3C PROV for medical document in standardised formats (e.g. a CDA document, a FHIR resource, a DICOM study, etc.); (2) a Java Proxy that intercepts all the document submissions and retrievals for which provenance shall be evaluated; (3) a service used to retrieve the PROV document.
Results
We integrated our decentralised platform with the SpiritEHR engine, an enterprise-grade healthcare system, and we stored and retrieved the available documents in the Mandel's sample CDA repository,11See https://github.com/jmandel/sample\_ccdas. which contained no protected health information. Using a cloud-based blockchain solution, we observed that the overhead added to the typical processing time of reading and writing medical data is in the order of milliseconds. Moreover, the integration of the Proxy at the level of exchanged messages in EHR systems allows transparent usage of provenance data in multiple health computing domains such as decision making, data reconciliation, and patient consent auditing.
Conclusions
By using international healthcare standards and a cloud-based blockchain deployment, we delivered a solution that can manage provenance of patients’ records via transparent integration within the routine operations on healthcare data.},

abstract="Cloud storage offers the flexibility of accessing data from anywhere at any time while providing economical benefits and scalability. However, cloud stores lack the ability to manage data provenance. Data provenance describes how a particular piece of data has been produced. It is vital for a post-incident investigation, widely used in healthcare, scientific collaboration, forensic analysis and legal proceedings. Data provenance needs to be secured since it may reveal private information about the sensitive data while the cloud service provider does not guarantee confidentiality of the data stored in dispersed geographical locations. This paper proposes a scheme to secure data provenance in the cloud while offering the encrypted search.",
