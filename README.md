2. Etw. messen? - Nein

3. Winterplan

## Meeting 13.12.21 ##

1. Hermeneutics - more detailed description

2. Search strings table

3. Use cases differences

4. Considered approaches table

## Meeting 06.12.21 ##

1. Method

2. Better Tables (relevant, more relevant, not relevant)


## Meeting 22.11.21 ##

1. Tables in 3.1 not necessary

2. TikZ !
	- tip - standalone package
	<br />
3. Leave only the **really** necessary requirements and characteristics


## Meeting 15.11.21 ##

1. Explain how the groups were formed

2. Use-Case-Tables: mark which sentances correspond to which requirement

3. Draw the links between Req-Table and Healthcare/Finance

4. Describe in which requirements finance and healthcare differ and which ones apply to both

5. Draw the links between Req-Table and Hyperledger/Ethereum

6. Describe which requirements Hyperledger and Ethereum fulfil

7. Describe only the useful DLT characteristics and properties

8. Think about the trade-offs


## Meeting 08.11.21 ##

0. Working Definition of DP 1-2 sentences
	- "The provenance of a data item includes information about the processes and sources that lead to its creation and current representation"
	<br />
1. Try to group Requirements (CIA, Data, System)

2. Make bigger destinction between individual medical/financial requirements

3. Add references in requirements.

4. Medical/Financial use case: differences and similarities
	- anonymity
	- target of abuse
	- accessibility
	- avail - emergency

5. Hyperledger/Ethereum statements in regard to the medical/financial requirements.

## Meeting 01.11.21 ##

1. References

2. Describe DP in our case

3. Stay away from Usage Control, Privacy, Security, anything outside of provenance

4. Separate requirements in important/unimportant in terms of our use case

5. Define Roles - Data Subject, Data Sender/Reciever, Type of Data, Transmiting priciple

6. Find financial literature

## Meeting 25.10.21 ##

0. Finance > Social

1. Define Data Provenance

2. Formulate Requirements for Data Provenance

3. Formulate Requirements specificaly for medical and financial use case

## Meeting 13.10.21 ##

0. Find a second use case (mobility, finance, etc.), which is the furthest from the medical use case

1. Determine requirements
	- for medical DP tools
	- for second use case DP tools
	- for both
	<br />
2. Compare/map to classic/typical privacy and security requirements

3. Look at as many different DLTs as possible
	- private/public
	- permissioned/permissionless
	<br />
4. Mapping results from 2. to DLT characteristics and capabilities from 3.
